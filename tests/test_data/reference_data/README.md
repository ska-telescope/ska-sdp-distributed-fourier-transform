Reference data for end-to-end tests

Reference data: generated by src/fourier_transform/test_algorithm.py on 24 Jan 2022
Reference data are stored in: tests/test_data/reference_data/

Important: I commented the non-relevant code out in test_algorithm.py before running it.
i.e. when I needed the results for the 1D case, I only ran that; when I needed them for
the 2D case, I commented the 1D parts out. This is to make sure results don't change
due to numpy.random being called different number of times between reference code and
tested code.

In addition, the following information is used for testing. It was printed by
test_algorithm.py. The code was run with numpy.random.seed(123456789).

The following target parameters were used:
TARGET_PARS = {
    "W": 13.25,
    "fov": 0.75,
    "N": 1024,  # total image size
    "Nx": 4,  # subgrid spacing
    "yB_size": 256,  # true usable image size (facet)
    "yN_size": 320,  # padding needed to transfer the data?
    "yP_size": 512,  # padded (rough) image size (facet)
    "xA_size": 188,  # true usable subgrid size
    "xM_size": 256,  # padded (rough) subgrid size
}

Set up:

== Chosen configuration
W = 13.25
fov = 0.75
N = 1024
Nx = 4
yB_size = 256
yN_size = 320
yP_size = 512
xA_size = 188
xM_size = 256
== Relative coordinates
xN=0.0207031 xM=0.125 yN=160 xNyN=3.3125 xA=0.0917969
== Derived values
xN_size=42.4 xM_yP_size=128, xMxN_yP_size=150, xM_yN_size=80
3x3 facets for FoV of 0.75 (100.0% efficiency)
6 subgrids, 4 facets needed to cover
